pulsar_B0329.mp3,"""PSR B0329+54""","""This pulsar is a typical, normal pulsar, rotating with a period of 0.714519 seconds, i.e. close to 1.40 rotations/sec.""",http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html
pulsar_B1937.mp3,"""PSR B1937+21""","""This is the second fastest known pulsar, rotating with a period of 0.00155780644887275 seconds, or about 642 times a second. The surface of this star is moving at about 1/7 of the velocity of light and illustrates the enormous gravitational forces which prevent it flying apart due to the immense centrifugal forces. The fastest-rotating pulsar is PSR J1748-2446ad, which rotates about 10% faster at 716 times a second.""",http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html
pulsar_crab.mp3,"""PSR B0531+21, The Crab Pulsar""","""This is the youngest known pulsar and lies at the centre of the Crab Nebula, the supernova remnant of its birth explosion, which was witnessed by Europeans and Chinese in the year 1054 A.D. as a day-time light in the sky. The pulsar rotates about 30 times a second.""",http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html
pulsar_J0437.mp3,"""PSR J0437-4715""","""This is a recently discovered millisecond pulsar, an old pulsar which has been spun up by the accretion of material from a binary companion star as it expands in its red giant phase. The accretion process results in orbital angular momentum of the companion star being converted to rotational angular momentum of the neutron star, which is now rotating about 174 times a second.""",http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html
pulsar_vela.mp3,"""PSR B0833-45, The Vela Pulsar""","""This pulsar lies near the centre of the Vela supernova remnant, which is the debris of the explosion of a massive star about 10,000 years ago. The pulsar is the collapsed core of this star, rotating with a period of 89 milliseconds or about 11 times a second.""",http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html

mars_opportunity.mp3, Mars,"""While the Mars rovers do not carry a microphones, this audio represents the journeys the Mars Opportunity rover has made while driving across the plains, mountains and craters of Mars during the last six years. 

Opportunity is mostly crossing a flat plain with dune fields and very few rocks. 

Engineers made these audio files with data from a device on the rover called an ""accelerometer,"" which is typically used to know the position of the rover on Mars. 

This device can also measure all the small bumps and vibrations the rover undergoes while moving. The sounds were made by converting the accelerometer data to WAV file (the format that Compact Discs use) and then finally to mp3. These vibrations are extremely low frequency, much lower than the human ear can hear. In order to hear these vibrations, engineers have sped them up about 1,000 times, much like playing a tape in fast forward on an old tape recorder. 

The audio excerpt is from drives around ""Concepcion"" crater.""",
jupiter.mp3, Jupiter,"""The signals in this sound file were acquired from Voyager 1’s plasma wave instrument as the spacecraft approached the 'sonic boom' (or bow shock, as scientists refer to it) of Jupiter in 1979. A sonic boom is created as the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically charged gas from the Sun, moves past the planets at supersonic speeds.

The chirps heard at the beginning of the interval are waves generated by electrons coming from the bow shock and moving 'upstream' into the approaching solar wind. These soon die out and, except for a slight hum from one of the science instruments onboard and the firing of one of Voyager's thrusters (making a short thud), things become quiet. Then suddenly, the spacecraft enters the bow shock and is enveloped by the turbulence in this planetary 'sonic boom.' ""

saturn.mp3, Saturn,""" From the far, far reaches of the Saturnian system, the Cassini spacecraft captures the most peculiar, chilling and downright hair-raising sounds of the ringed world’s intense radio emissions.  The radio waves, recorded by the spacecraft’s radio and plasma instrument and converted into audio recordings, are closely related to the auroras near Saturn’s poles. These auroras are similar to Earth's northern and southern lights.""",http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/sounds/index-flash.html
